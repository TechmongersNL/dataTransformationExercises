# Data transformation exercises

## Today we practice & expand upon: map, filter, reduce, find 

Because we in JavaScript we often have to deal with array's of object. Use map, filter, reduce in find:

## This repo has exercises with tests

- There are test files set up that check the functionality of the functions you have to write.
- Test files end with .test.js, write your code in the corresponding js. file. 
- 1.map-filter-find.js are exercise recap simple map, filter and find. Choose the appropriate method for each function.
- 2.reduce.js are exercises that recap reduce and expand on more powerful ways to use it (it's super effective!).
- 3.data-mining.js are exercises where you have to combine different pieces of data, (gyms, trainers and pokemon) to get the information you need. That can mean nesting maps & find or chaining array methods together in a multi-step process.


## How to do these exercises:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Codaisseur/dataTransFormationExercises.git
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the exercises
# 1.)
npm run exercise1
# 2.)
npm run exercise2
# 3.) 
npm run exercise3
# all
npm run test
```

Running the exercises this way will make use of the `--watch` functionality of jest. 

- That means that when you change your code, the tests will be run again (It's super ef.. well you get the idea).
- To stop running the tests you can press `ctrl + c`
